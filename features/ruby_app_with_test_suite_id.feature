Feature: Ruby App with Test Suite ID

  Adding rspec-tracer without simplecov should generate tracer reports and the
  coverage report as well. It should skip some examples when cache found and no
  dependency change is detected.

  Scenario: Ruby App with Test Suite ID
    Given I am working on the project "ruby_app"
    And I use "without_simplecov.rb" as spec helper
    And I use test suite id 1
    When I run specs using "rspec spec/course_spec.rb"
    Then The RSpecTracer should print the information
      """

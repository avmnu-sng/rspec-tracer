Feature: Ruby App Explicit Run

  Adding rspec-tracer with simplecov should generate tracer reports and the
  coverage report as well. It should skip some examples when cache found and no
  dependency change is detected.

  Scenario: Ruby App Explicit Run
    Given I am working on the project "ruby_app"
    And I use "with_simplecov.rb" as spec helper
    When I run specs using "rspec spec"
    Then The RSpecTracer should print the information

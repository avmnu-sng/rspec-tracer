Feature: Ruby App with Incorrect Analysis

  Adding rspec-tracer with simplecov should generate tracer reports and the
  coverage report as well. It should skip some examples when cache found and no
  dependency change is detected.

  Scenario: Ruby App with Incorrect Analysis
    Given I am working on the project "calculator_2_app"
    When I cd to "project"
    And I run specs using "rspec spec"
    Then The RSpecTracer should print the duplicate examples report

Feature: Rails App with SimpleCov

  Adding rspec-tracer with simplecov should generate tracer reports and the
  coverage report as well. It should skip some examples when cache found and no
  dependency change is detected.

  Scenario: Rails App with SimpleCov
    Given I am working on the project "rails_app"
    And I use "with_simplecov.rb" as spec helper
    When I run specs using "rspec spec"
    Then The RSpecTracer should print the information
